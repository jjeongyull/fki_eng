          Even when reviewing overseas legislative examples, it is difficult to find cases where the shareholders’ interests and the company’s interests are defined as separate concepts. The regulations that mention shareholders typically express the general notion that “company interests = shareholder interests.” One of the examples cited by proponents of the Commercial Act amendment is the Delaware General Corporation Law (Section 102(b)(7)) in the United States.

          Many scholars explain that this provision is simply a general statement that “if it benefits the company, it will also benefit the shareholders,” and it cannot be interpreted as imposing a duty on directors to prioritize shareholder interests separately from company interests.

          <p class="gold-line-text">Delaware General Corporation Law Section 102(a) lists the “required provisions of the certificate of incorporation,” with Section 102(b) enumerating the “optional provisions that may be included.” ⇒ Therefore, companies may voluntarily choose to include in their certificate of incorporation a provision stating that “directors are not exempt from liability for breach of fiduciary duty to shareholders.” However, this does not mandate a fiduciary duty to shareholders as a compulsory regulation.</p>

          Upon closer examination of the foreign legislative examples cited to support the Commercial Act amendment, it is clear that they do not specifically impose on directors a fiduciary duty toward shareholders. Even among the few international legislative examples presented by proponents, there is no case where directors are explicitly required to bear fiduciary duties toward shareholders in advanced economies.

          A Personalized Diet Just for You
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          Originally designed for the elderly who struggle with food intake or need special dietary care due to illness, “care food” products are known for being easy to prepare, chew, and digest, while offering sufficient nutritional value.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          As more consumers seek tailored diets for health management, the care food market continues to grow. The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety announced in April that the domestic care food market reached KRW 506.7 billion in 2022, marking a 15.3% increase from the previous year and an average annual growth rate of 7.9% over the past five years. This trend has expanded to include younger, health-conscious consumers, as well as children and pregnant women. In Korea, personalized nutrition and food nano-customization have become widespread as people choose products that cater to their preferences, life stages, and health conditions.

          Diving Deep into Health
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          As a combination of “Health” and “Digging,” Health-Digging refers to exploring health information in-depth to discover personalized health management methods. While most people in the past relied on expert advice or traditional practices, health management today is increasingly shaped by personal choices and information gathering. The trend reflects the autonomy that individuals now have in understanding their health, sharing information, and creating better lives for themselves. This shift is a result of modern society’s improved access to information.

        <p class="sub-p-text">
          According to the February 2024 IDL Report by Incross Data Lab, individuals in their 40s to 60s frequently use medical services and step-counting apps like Samsung S Health, M Health Insurance, and WalkOn. Meanwhile, those in their 20s and 30s use running and body composition tracking apps like Samsung S Health, Nike Run Club, and InBody, along with sleep and meditation apps such as Sleep Cycle and Calm.

          Digital Meets Analog
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          While the fourth industrial revolution—fueled by AI, big data, and IoT—gains momentum, ironically, “analog” is making a comeback. As a blend of “digital” DigLog and “analog,” refers to the fusion of tangible aspects of analog with digital technology to create new value. This trend aligns with the global retro movement. According to a Trend Monitor survey on the perceptions of retro culture and hip traditions, 7 out of 10 respondents positively view the emergence of retro concepts across various fields.

          hip traditions, 7 out of 10 respondents positively view the emergence of retro concepts across various fields. To cater to this trend, industries are offering products that recreate analog experiences through digital advancements such as e-pens that simulate handwriting on paper, and Bluetooth LP turntables. As digital life accelerates, people are finding comfort and balance in products that incorporate a nostalgic, analog feel—a trend that is likely to continue.

          Healthy and Graceful Aging
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          Korea’s beauty trend is shifting from “anti-aging” to “slow aging.” Unlike anti-aging, which sees aging as something to resist, slow aging embraces it naturally with focus on consistent care to age gracefully and healthily.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          An analysis of beauty community posts and SNS hashtags shows that slow aging is becoming a new lifestyle across all age groups. Major beauty brands like CJ Olive Young, Amorepacific, and LG Household & Health Care have launched related functional cosmetics to meet this demand. CJ Olive Young reported a 70% increase in sales of slow-aging products in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year. Slow-aging campaigns are expected to continue in the second half of the year.

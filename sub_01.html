            The global economic environment is rapidly changing. With geopolitical risks and climate change, our businesses face an increasingly unpredictable future. Smart responses based on diverse information and ideas are more critical than mere predictions.
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            This is why the launch of FKI’s magazine is receiving more attention than ever before. I hope that FKI’s sharp analysis, the entrepreneurial spirit that society desires, and engaging insights into global trends will secure a place on the shelves of opinion leaders both at home and abroad. Just as the magazine’s title, <i>다함께, ALL TOGETHER</i>, suggests, KCCI will cooperate in various ways.

            Congratulations on the launch of <i>다함께, ALL TOGETHER</i>, which will become the new face of the Federation of Korean Industries. As Korea’s leading economic organization, FKI has worked alongside KBIZ to advance the national economy.
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            Over the past 60 years, large corporations and SMEs have supported each other’s growth, much like the trunk and branches of a single tree, contributing to the current Korean economy.

          <p class="sub-p-text">
            However, the future will emphasize the creation of new value through the convergence of industries, making it even more crucial to strengthen the collaborative growth of large and small businesses.
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">  
            Currently, companies are facing unprecedented challenges due to the highly unpredictable domestic and international state of affairs. To turn a crisis into an opportunity, what we need most is accurate information and diverse perspectives.
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">  
            Building on the various activities of the Federation of Korean Industries, the magazine, relaunched after 10 years, is expected to play a crucial role during this paradigm shift in the global economy by offering a comprehensive overview of global industrial trends and the entrepreneurial insights of key business figures.
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">  
            Once again, I extend my congratulations on the magazine’s launch. Along with 7.71 million SMEs, KBIZ will continue to support and applaud <i>다함께, ALL TOGETHER</i> as we work together to create a “better future.”

            I sincerely congratulate the FKI on the relaunch of its premium economic magazine, <i>다함께, ALL TOGETHER</i>.
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            This revival, which comes after the final publication of <i>Monthly FKI</i> 10 years ago, holds great significance as it reflects the determination and passion of business leaders who have played a pivotal role in Korea’s economic development.
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            Over the past few decades, Korea’s economy has achieved remarkable growth, becoming one of the top 10 global economic powers and one of the seven major trading nations, driven by our companies’ relentless technological innovation and entrepreneurial spirit amid the global division of labor based on free trade.
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">  
            However, the intensifying U.S.-China rivalry is leading to the fragmentation and restructuring of global supply chains, the spread of protectionism, and fierce competition for technological dominance in areas like semiconductors and AI, causing rapid changes in the international trade environment.
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">  
            In this era of significant shifts in the global trade order, I hope that FKI’s magazine will serve as a valuable resource that amplifies the voices of business leaders, shares wisdom and experience, and presents new visions. I also expect it to enhance the competitiveness of local companies and create opportunities for the Korean economy to take a new leap forward.
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">  
            Once again, congratulations on the magazine’s relaunch, and I wish the FKI continued success and boundless growth.

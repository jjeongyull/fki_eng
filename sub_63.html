        Workplace Mindset and Onboarding

        <p class="gold-line-text">After 13 months at his job, 28-year-old Seong-su Lee (not his real name) submitted his resignation and uploaded a “quitting vlog” to YouTube. He also plans to share a vlog about his journey into a new career. This is not an isolated case, but rather a growing trend among today’s youth. In an era where lifelong jobs and permanent colleagues no longer exist, it is crucial to understand the workplace mindset of the new generation and develop onboarding strategies accordingly.</p>

          Onboarding Programs Have Become Essential
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          For today’s young professionals, accumulating experiences across different companies is seen as a way of enhancing personal growth. Increasingly, they value meaningful work and self-development over high salaries, driving their decision to switch jobs. A government survey in 2023 found that the turnover rate within the first year of employment was 16.5%, and 32% within five. The cycle of welcomes and farewells in the workplace has become shorter.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          Given this situation, HR departments are facing mounting challenges. Early integration programs aimed at helping ambitious young talent settle in have become a major focus for companies. Supporting new employees in adjusting to company culture, onboarding programs have evolved into a must-have feature in the past few years.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          At the core of an onboarding program is “the alignment between individual needs and the company’s vision.” It is important to convince young professionals that their personal growth goals are in line with the company’s vision, encouraging them to unleash their talents fully, enjoy their experiences, and achieve meaningful outcomes. By adopting this approach in onboarding strategy, companies can successfully retain talent, and individuals can enhance their expertise and value, forming a mutually beneficial relationship.

            1. Pre-Onboarding: Nerves Before Joining
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            Pre-onboarding is a crucial phase as most new hires feel anxious before starting. It is important to pay close attention to this stage. Along with the standard procedures like sending a welcome guide and an offer letter, a personal touch such as a welcome call or a brief greeting from the team leader can make a big difference. Be sure to prepare a clean workspace, the necessary work equipment, and a welcome package to show your interest in and appreciation for the new hire.

            2. Mentorship Program: The Boss Is the Company!
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            The first impression that a new employee gets from his or her seniors or leader becomes his or her impression of the company itself. Assigning a mentor who is experienced in the company culture and work processes helps new employees adapt quickly to their roles and build relationships within the organization.

          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            Clear feedback focuses on delivering direct, fact-based insights that confirm outcomes and identify areas for improvement. Instead of haphazard questioning, leaders and new employees should engage in structured discussions around expectations and challenges. Offering insights into the relevant work relationships, current projects, or helpful case studies can help new employees better understand the company and deepen their engagement.

            4. Onboarding Review Workshop: Onboarding Is Over, Now the Real Work Begins!
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            After the onboarding process is completed, an onboarding review workshop helps evaluate its effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. Provide new employees with an open platform to share their thoughts about the company; be open to hearing ideas that they may have benchmarked from previous employers. Since this interview takes on the nature of performance management, team leaders should ideally conduct it personally and maintain ongoing oversight.

          Parting Ways Gracefully
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          Offboarding, the opposite of onboarding, refers to giving a departing employee a respectful, positive send-off.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          Beyond the essential steps like handovers and security agreements, why not prepare a heartfelt thank-you message or a farewell event? Reaching out to former key members with a small gift as well as updates on the company’s milestones or growth events can also leave a lasting impression.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          For younger generations navigating their careers, they are not just looking at company websites or job listings—they are interested in hearing the real experiences from people who have worked there. Indeed, candid stories about working conditions constantly surface in online communities. When positive anecdotes about a company spread, they help build and amplify a favorable reputation, benefiting the company in the long run.

The plan includes establishing a sustainable business structure by clearly defining the direction of five strategic business units: basic chemicals, advanced materials, specialty chemicals, battery materials, and hydrogen energy.

              Australian NEL Road Project in Full Swing

            <p class="sub-p-text">
              GS E&C’s Australian NEL Road Project officially gained traction on July 24. With total investment of KRW 10.1 trillion, this large-scale project involves constructing a 6.5-kilometer tunnel connecting Melbourne’s M80 Ring Road with the Eastern Freeway. GS E&C’s portion of the project is approximately KRW 2.8 trillion. Notably, this is GS E&C’s first venture into Australia’s infrastructure market, and the project is being implemented as a Public-Private Partnership (PPP)—a model recently gaining renewed attention for its collaboration between private entities and the government. Leveraging its years of construction expertise and PPP project capabilities, GS E&C is aiming to complete the project by the end of December 2028.

            </p>
            <p class="sub-p-text">
              A call for easing regulatory discrimination unique to Korea and based on company size has been made to ensure smoother growth for companies and boost economic vitality. In response, FKI co-hosted a seminar with the Korean Academy of High Potential Enterprises and the Federation of Middle Market Enterprises of Korea on June 3 at the FKI Tower Conference Center. Titled “Scaling Up Business Growth,” the seminar discussed the need to improve regulations on business diversification for medium-sized companies, systematize the scope of medium-sized enterprises through the enactment of the Framework Act on Middle Market Enterprises, and reduce the excessive tax support gap based on company size.

              Survey of Large Companies’ 2H2024 Investment Plans
            </p>
            <p class="sub-p-text">
              FKI commissioned Mono Research to survey the top 500 companies in terms of revenue (132 respondents) on their domestic investment plans for the second half of 2024. The survey found that 74.2% of respondents plan to maintain similar levels of investment as in the first half of the year, with 16.7% planning to increase investment and 9.1% seeking to reduce it. Despite concerns over prolonged high interest rates, high exchange rates, and global uncertainty, 3 out of 4 major companies plan to maintain first-half investment levels in the second half. Additionally, more companies plan to expand investments than reduce them, suggesting that corporate investments may improve in the latter half of the year compared to the first.
